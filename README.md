## Assignment 2018

### last commit on or before November 11th, 2018

#### Problem Statement

This assignment concerns the well-known Anscombe's quartet dataset. Students are required to create a Jupyter notebook analyising the dataset. There are four distinct tanks to be carried out using the Jupyter notebook:

##### Task 1

Explain the background to the dataset - who created it, when it was created, and any speculation you can find regarding how it might have been created.

##### Task 2

Plot the interesting aspects of the dataset.

##### Task 3

Calculate the descriptive statistics of the variables in the dataset. 

##### Task 4
Explain why the dataset is interesting, referring to the plots and statistics calculated. 

#### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

Create a GitHub account and clone or copy the repository. Public access has been granted to the repository and is available for use under the terms of the APACHE licence. 

Link: https://github.com/SimonMcLain/GMIT-Fundaments-of-Data-Analysis---Practicals.git 

To run the file open it in Juypter notebook, which is included in the anaconda download. See Prerequsites below. 

On the command line access the repository on your local machine, run Juypter notebook and open the file named Fundamentals-of-Data-Analysis-Practical.

Once the file is open in Jupyter notebook on the ribbon click on Kernal, then restart and run all. The charts and descriptive statistics will be displayed.

For convienence a copy of Anscombe's Quartet has been provided in the GitHub repository, if you choose not to use the provided dataset you will be required to edit the relevant line in my the Jupyter notebook


#### Prerequisites

Your will require Python to be loaded on your local machine. I recommend downloading and installing Anaconda.

https://www.anaconda.com/download/
